get the table of ports forwarded on your digicel router

# main use case/inspo

Using Selenium and Python 3, this script will run every 15 minutes and login to your digicel router, scan the ports table, and output the results to a json file. This was used in conjunction with a discord bot to allow a discord server to get access to the public ip and port for port 25565 allowing users to play on their homebrewed Minecraft server.
